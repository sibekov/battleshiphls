"The lessons are perfect, and you deserve much in the way of our thanks and gratitude. 
Being a Bible teacher, I am familiar with how very much work goes into a teaching project.
To make it easy and slow takes a great deal of work, and much detail on your part. The care
and time you have invested is evident and you have done a remarkable job. The translation was 
amazing, and I was sitting, but you get a standing ovation from me."
